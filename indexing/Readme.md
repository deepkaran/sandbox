##Couchbase Secondary Indexes

Secondary Index Project aims to provide an alternative to the existing map-reduce based 
*Hash Partitioned Secondary Indexes*(known as Views) available in Couchbase. 
This project is being built from ground up to improve the existing solution and
support new use-cases e.g. N1QL.

###Goals and Motivation

- **Performance** – Support index clustering to avoid scatter/gather and index working set management
- **Independent Scaling** – Enable secondary index to scale independent of Key-value workload
- **Partitioning Scheme Flexibility** – Can support for different partitioning schemes for index data (hash, range, key)
- **Indexing Structure Flexibility** – Can support for different indexing structure (b-tree/trie, hash, R+ tree)
- **Scan Consistency** – Using timestamp to ensure query stability and consistency
