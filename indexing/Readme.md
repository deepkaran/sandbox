Goals and Motivation (Can get PM help)
Independent Scaling – Ease of scaling by allocating dedicated resources for different kinds of workload (e.g. KV versus indexing)
Enable predictable index range scan latency (e.g. Independent of KV cluster size)
Improve latency and throughput on existing solution (do a comparative study with Views — with Sarath help)
Support N1QL use case
Query Stability 
Consistency Requirement
Performance Goals
Design Principle
Timestamp based for consistency/stability
Event Streaming and Routing – E.g. An index replica can also be a source of event generation (not just projector)
Network Protocol Independent
Active Replica
Partitioning Scheme Independent 
Storage Layer Independent 
Challenges
Network Bandwidth 
Memory
Storage Performance
